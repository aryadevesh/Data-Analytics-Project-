Introduction 

The Employee Analysis package is designed to analyze employee performance data, apply various transformations, and categorize employees based on their performance ratings. This package uses design patterns like Strategy, Factory, and Facade to ensure modularity and maintainability. 

Installation 

To install the package, navigate to the root directory (where setup.py is located) and run: 

pip install .

Usage 

To use the Employee Analysis package in your project, you can use the EmployeeAnalysisFacade class to run the complete workflow: 

 

from employee_analysis import EmployeeAnalysisFacade 
 
csv_file = "path/to/your/dataset.csv" 
facade = EmployeeAnalysisFacade(csv_file) 
facade.run() 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Modules 

Employee Analysis Facade 

The EmployeeAnalysisFacade class provides a simplified interface to run the entire employee analysis process. 

Methods 

__init__(self, csv_file): Initializes the facade with the specified CSV file. 

load_data(self): Loads the data from the CSV file. 

clean_data(self): Cleans the data by handling missing values and outliers. 

calculate_ratings(self): Calculates performance ratings for employees. 

apply_transformations(self, ratings): Applies various transformations to the ratings. 

find_best_p_value(self, transformations): Finds the best p-value for the Shapiro-Wilk test. 

categorize_employees(self, ratings): Categorizes employees based on their ratings. 

plot_normal_distribution(self, mean, std, thresholds): Plots the normal distribution of employee performance. 

save_categorized_employees(self, categories): Saves the categorized employees to a CSV file. 

run(self): Executes the complete workflow. 

Transformations 

The transformations module contains classes that implement different transformation strategies using the Strategy design pattern. 

Base Class 

TransformationStrategy: Abstract base class for transformations. 

apply(self, data): Abstract method to apply the transformation. 

name(self): Abstract method to return the name of the transformation. 

test_normality(self, data): Tests the normality of the data using the Shapiro-Wilk test. 

Concrete Classes 

OriginalTransformation: Applies no transformation. 

LogTransformation: Applies a logarithmic transformation. 

SqrtTransformation: Applies a square root transformation. 

BoxCoxTransformation: Applies a Box-Cox transformation. 

InverseTransformation: Applies an inverse transformation. 

Factory Class 

TransformationFactory: Provides a method to get all transformation strategies. 

get_transformations(): Returns a list of all available transformation strategies. 

Utilities 

The utils module contains utility functions used by the package. 

Functions 

load_data(csv_file): Loads data from the specified CSV file. 

Testing 

Unit tests are provided in the tests module. To run the tests, use a test runner like unittest: 

python -m unittest discover tests 
 

Examples 

Here's an example of using the EmployeeAnalysisFacade to run the analysis: 

 

from employee_analysis import EmployeeAnalysisFacade 
 
csv_file = "Uncleaned_employees_final_dataset (1).csv" 
facade = EmployeeAnalysisFacade(csv_file) 
facade.run()
